# Display

A display of my some of my projects, from classes and personal interests. 

Each project can be found in its own respective directory. Below are descriptions of each project, where they originated from and what they taught me. 

While each directory shows a piece of my programming experience, I recommend viewing **Mini[Max]Games** as it has been the largest and most sophisticated project I've completed to date. 

## Binary Tree

The Binary Tree directory contains some binary tree structure code in Java designed to allow a user to keep a record of personal contact information.

This was an assignment from Whatcom Community College's Intro to Computer Science II. 

It taught me basic tree structure, as well as the basics of OOP with Java's class system. 

## Hunt The Wumpus

Hunt The Wumpus is a simple CLI based game built in C++. 

This was an assignment from Oregon State's Intro to Computer Science II. 

It taught me the fundamentals of polymorphism and encapsulation. Each event object in the game, like the wumpus or the bat swarm, is a child of the event class. Using keyboard command line input, the user can move through a grid that is the Wumpus's cave. They can encounter events in the game if they move into the event's square. 

## Linked List

Similar to the Binary Tree directory, the linked list directory provides some hand-written linked list structure code in C++ for use with single integer values. It also provides recursive merge sort functionality, both in ascending and descending order. 

This was an assignment from Oregon State's Intro to Computer Science II. 

While this assignment gave me more practice with polymorphism, it also forced me to work through a recursive sorting problem, which gave me practice with complexity analysis and recursive algorithms. 

## Mini[Max]Games

Mini[Max]Games is a Python & Flask based web application that allows the user to play Tic-Tac-Toe, Minesweeper, Nim and Connect 4 either against a friend or against a computer opponent. 

This served as my final project for Harvard's CS50. It also uses a lot of skills built from Harvard's CS50AI. 

This was a very large production that taught me a lot about the basics of program development. Using the Python library Flask, I could pair the backend game logic in Python with the frontend HTML, JS and CSS. 

Beyond the nature of developing web applications, this project expands into introductory machine learning. Hence the name, it uses the MiniMax algorithm as its engine for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4, and two other machine learning algorithms more specific to their respective games. CS50AI taught me a lot about the basics of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

All of the above and more of the specifics of this project can be found within its own README.md.
