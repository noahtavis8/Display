            <p>This combination of programs will serve as my submission for CS50's</p>
            <p>final project. If learning more about computer programming sounds</p>
            <p>interesting to you, I'd highly recommend checking them out at 
                <a href="https://www.edx.org">Edx.</a></p>
            <p>The course is free and it covers a wide range of programming basics, 
                from C to SQL to Python.</p>
